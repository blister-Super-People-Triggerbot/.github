## 🔍 What Is a Triggerbot?

A **triggerbot** is a cheat that automatically fires your weapon the moment your crosshair touches an enemy target—based on visual hitboxes or ESP lock data. Unlike aimbots (which adjust your aim), triggerbots let *you* aim naturally while the cheat **handles the shooting**.

It’s perfect for players who want to **look legit** but land first shots like a pro.
